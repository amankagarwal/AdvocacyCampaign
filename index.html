						<h2>The Issue of
							<br />
							Climate Change:</h2>
							<p>Climate change continues to be one of the most important global issues confronting the whole of the international community.  Yet, surprisingly, the issue of climate change is poorly covered by the media. This has led to the general public having a lack of understanding of both the science and the policy implications of climate change. It is thus important to educate the public about the implications of climate change in order to avoid certain unforeseen consequences which I address.
								<br></p>
								<h2>	What do people currently think about the issue?</h2>
								<p>
									Interestingly, about half of Americans do not think that climate change will affect them. It is important that we understand why this is the case to successfully tackle this issue. Recently, Gallup conducted a poll that shows that many Americans “perceive climate change as a distance problem” (Gallup). Majority of people, not only in America, perceive climate change as a distant issue. The underlying reason why most people think of this as a distant issue is a lack of understanding of the science behind climate change. This lack of scientific background can also account for upcoming conspirators who think that “climate change is a Chinese hoax” (Trump).
									<br>
								</p>
								<h2>Long-term consequences of Climate Change:</h2>
								<p>There are several consequences of global warming and climate change, and even a seemingly slight average temperature rise is enough to cause a dramatic transformation of our planet. Human influences are the number one cause of global warming- the rise in carbon pollution due to burning fossil fuels, forests. In the documentary “An Inconvenient Truth”, Gore uses the below illustration to demonstrate the long-term consequences of high Carbon dioxide emissions, and its correlation to rising temperature. The main point he draws from this illustration is that rising carbon dioxide emissions means higher temperatures.
									<br>
									Higher temperatures are worsening many types of disasters, including storms, heat waves, floods and droughts. The increasing number of droughts, intense storms and floods as the Earths warming atmospheres holds and dumps more moisture poses risks to public safety and health as well. Prolonged dry spells due to warming atmospheres jeopardizes access to clean drinking water. Past events already indicate that lack of clean water can be a leading cause of death and serious illnesses. Rising temperature are also associated to higher death rates- hundreds of heat-related deaths occur each year due to direct impacts and the indirect effects of heat-exacerbated, life threatening illnesses, such as heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and cardiovascular and kidney diseases.
									<br>
									However, the most concerning long-term consequence of global warming and climate are not the prolonged natural disasters. It’s the fact that we might not have a habitable planet to foster future generations unless we act on the issue of climate change right now.

							<h4>Figure: Al-Gore describing the long-term consequences of global warming and climate change</h4>
							<p>Illustrations like the above and proof about the impact of climate change on our environment is the best way we can put forth the viewpoint above. Glaciers are melting faster than ever causing the sea levels to rise and therefore more natural disasters.

								In order to make this viewpoint come across as knowledge, we must be able to justify our claim with quality evidence. Evidence such as that of the Glacier National Park show us the first-hand impact of rising temperatures due to climate change and global warming. The increasing number of tornados and natural disasters is also an indicator that climate change is indeed real, and we must demonstrate our point by highlighting existing evidence we possess.

							<h2>How to increase climate change awareness?</h2>

							<p>As said before, human influences are the biggest factor that contribute to global warming and climate change. First, we must be able to put forth the point that the issue of climate change exists among as many people possible. However, in order to do that we need more journalists who are willing to talk about science related issues. Media has been one of the most powerful tools in the past decade- however, currently most journalists are generalists and have little training in science or the environment specially climate change in particular. Thus, in we must organize for a way to train these journalists and editors who may be willing to learn more about climate change. One way we could achieve this could be to have governments and private media organizations forge partnerships in order to jointly fund the training of journalists. If we have more science-educated journalists, we are more likely to have a larger audience that understands the issue of climate change.
								<br>
								Companies like Facebook and Google can also play a huge role in increasing awareness about the issue. They can tie up with government organizations to have certain advertisement models that target as big as an audience possible. Also, government can formulate certain policies like banning sale of fireworks to the public in order to reduce the amount of emissions.
								<br>
								Increasing awareness about issues by demonstrating the consequences that may cause has been a successful strategy in the past as well. In India, for the past 5 years there has been increased awareness about the consequences of bursting crackers on one of the biggest festivals – Diwali. Recently, the Supreme Court even banned the sale of fireworks in order to protect the environment. This increased awareness and stricter policies have indeed led to reduce pollution due to bursting crackers.
							</p>
							<h2>Platforms, Styles of Communication</h2>
							<p>It’s however really important we target the audience using the correct platforms and styles of communication. We must use a variety of platforms to demonstrate this issue. A lot of countries and places do not have access to Social media websites like Facebook. In such places, we must organize workshops to educate the public. We cannot simply have journalists doing interviews for news channels, since the younger age demographic often spend more time on websites like Facebook and YouTube rather than watching news channels or reading newspapers.

								Therefore, it is important that we have a collective effort and use as many platforms available to us to reach out to all the demographics. We also should not throw a lot of technical jargon to a scientifically uneducated audience; thus, use of illustrations and archival footage or in other words appealing to pathos is an effective way of educating the public about such science related issues.
